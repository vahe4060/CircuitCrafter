## Circuit Crafter 

*Circuit Crafter* was developed as my bachelor's thesis and has since evolved into a personal hobby project that I continue to work on. It's cross platform a GUI schematic editor designed to simplify the creation of schematic designs and their conversion to Verilog. This tool makes the schematic design process easier and more enjoyable for hardware engineers. 


## How to Use

Simply open the project in Qt Creator and build with QMake.


### TODO-s

1. Migrate to Qt6 âœ… 
2. Refactor to meet a design pattern (MVC) 
3. Fix leaks (Valgrind)
4. Add undo/redo stack
5. Add mouse navigation

### Nice to Have Enhancements

* make self-fed inputs possible
* implement triggers (D, JK, T, SR)
* implement possibility for custom operators/modules
* optimize schematic parsing to a non-JSON format
* (Dream) layout generation
